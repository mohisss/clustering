This Python code is designed to compare different clustering algorithms on a customer dataset and find the optimal number of clusters. Hereâ€™s a summary of what the code does:

Imports necessary libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries - matplotlib for data visualization, numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, pylab for plotting, and sklearn for machine learning.

Loads the dataset and selects relevant columns: The code reads the customer dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. It then selects the relevant columns that contain numerical features of the customers, such as balance, purchases, cash advance, credit limit, payments, etc. It also drops any rows that have missing values.

Defines a function to calculate the disturbance matrix: The code defines a function that takes an array of data points and an array of cluster labels as inputs, and returns a matrix that contains the pairwise distances between the data points within each cluster. This matrix is used to evaluate the quality of the clustering.

Defines a function to evaluate the clustering algorithm based on the disturbance matrix: The code defines a function that takes a disturbance matrix as input, and returns a scalar value that represents the sum of the distances within each cluster. The lower the value, the better the clustering.

Compares different clustering algorithms and finds the optimal number of clusters: The code iterates over a range of possible numbers of clusters, from 2 to 5. For each number of clusters, it initializes three clustering algorithms: K-means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN. It then fits and predicts the cluster labels for each algorithm on the customer data. It then calculates the disturbance matrix and the evaluation value for each algorithm. It stores the evaluation values in lists for later plotting.

Creates subplots for each clustering algorithm: The code creates a figure with three subplots, one for each clustering algorithm. It plots the evaluation values against the number of clusters for each algorithm. It also sets the title, labels, and axes for each subplot.

Displays the plots: Finally, the code displays the plots using plt.show()
